package org.typelevel.jawn.util

/**
 * Character sequence representing a lazily-calculated substring.
 *
 * This class has three constructors:
 *
 *   - Slice(s) wraps a string, ensuring that future operations (e.g. subSequence) will construct slices instead of
 *     strings.
 *   - Slice(s, start, limit) is the default, and ensures that:
 *
 *   1. start >= 0 2. limit >= start 3. limit <= s.length
 *
 *   - Slice.unsafe(s, start, limit) is for situations where the above bounds-checking has already occurred. Only use
 *     this if you are absolutely sure your arguments satisfy the above invariants.
 *
 * Slice's subSequence returns another slice. This means that when wrapping a very large string, garbage collection on
 * the underlying string will not occur until all slices are freed.
 *
 * Slice's universal equality is only defined with regard to other slices. This means comparing a Slice with other
 * CharSequence values (including String) will always return false.
 *
 * Slices are serializable. However! They use the default Java serialization layout, which is not that efficient, and
 * could be a disaster in cases where a large shared string might be serialized many times in different slices.
